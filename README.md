# JSCalculator

During the web-period at CodeCool,
we had to examine a Javascript Calculator example.
On the next stand-alone week,
our task was to extend it with an interesting functionality
using AJAX.

Task descriptions can be found here:
* [Make a calculator using JS and CSS3](description%231.md)
